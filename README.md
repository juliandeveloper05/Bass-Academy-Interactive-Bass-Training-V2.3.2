Project Title: Patitucci's Linear 11ths Exercise v2

Description: This application is a specialized practice tool for bassists looking to master linear arpeggios, a technique popularized by jazz fusion legend John Patitucci. Unlike traditional "box shape" playing, this exercise focuses on extending arpeggios horizontally and vertically across the fretboard using 11th chord voicings (Emaj11 and Fm11).

Key Features:

Interactive Tablature: Visual feedback that highlights notes in real-time as they are played.

Web Audio Engine: Custom synthesizer built with the Web Audio API to simulate a bass tone without external samples.

Practice Tools: Fully adjustable BPM (Tempo) and Loop Mode to practice at your own pace.

Music Theory: Focuses on triplet phrasing and modern jazz harmony (Extensions: 9ths and 11ths).
